## Practical8

Here we find the gcd of two integers using what is known as iterative and recurssive method. Both are contained in the same program but as different functions.

1. recurssionPrac8.c - Contains code to find out gcd for two numbers using iterative function as well as recurssive function.

 ### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o recurssionPrac8 recurssionPrac8.c
    2. ./recurssionPrac8
