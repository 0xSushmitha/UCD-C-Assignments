## Practical7

Here the main catch for these practicals are pointers. We use dynamic allocation to allocate the order to calculate the formula of exponential function and display estimate for each order and free the space after usage. The insights for the practical is listed as a comment in the c file. In the second practical, we practice on allocating spaces for pointers and making them free after displaying the pointers.

1. exponentialP7.c - Contains code to calculate exponential using a function f(x) and find which order provides an accurate value.

### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o exponentialP7 exponentialP7.c
    2. ./exponentialP7

2. pointerManipulationP7.c - Code to practice different kind of usage of pointers

### Command to compile and run the code
