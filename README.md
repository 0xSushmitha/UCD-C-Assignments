# UCD-C-Assignments

**This repository will contain the practicals done with C programming in Ichec. Contents for each practical will be listed here and the command to run the same using gcc will be given here.**

## Practical 1

1. printing.c - Prints integer and floating numbers onto the screen
2. scanning.c - We obtain two numbers from the user and determine whether if its even or odd.

## Practical 2

1. conversion.c - We convert an interger decimal to a binary and do cast conversion from int to float and print the three numbers.
2. sum.c - We find the sum of the given expression using for loop and find the same from reverse and display the difference.

## Practical 3

1. areaCurve.C - We have used the trapezodial rule to calculate area under the curve.

## Practical4

1. arrayFunctionPrac4.c - Contains the same area under the curve program but have used functions to calculate the given degree to radians and to calculate the area.

## Practical5

1. fibonacci_prac5.c - Its a program to compute the fibonacci series till the given number number n.
2. maclaurinSeriesPrac5.c - Program to compute Maclaurin Series for a number

## Practical6

1. main.c - Main program to get input of two matrices and display its product
2. matmul.c - Contains the function to calculate matric multiplication
3. makefile - contains the makefile to compile the two files and get an executable.

## Practical7

1. exponentialP7.c - Contains code to calculate exponential using a function f(x) and find which order provides an accurate value.
2. pointerManipulationP7.c - Code to practice different kind of usage of pointers

## Practical8

1. recurssionPrac8.c - Contains code to find out gcd for two numbers using iterative function as well as recussive function.

## Practical9

1. magic_square.h - Contains function to find whether a matrix is magic or not. We will include this in out main.c and invoke in main function. 
2. magic_square1.txt - Input of a 3*3 magic matrix to verify the code.
3. not_magic_square.txt - Input of a 3*3 non magic matrix to verify the code.
4. main.c - Contains code to initialise matrix ,read matrix from file and invoke function from magic_square.h file. Then with the result from the function, we display is the matrix is magic or not.
