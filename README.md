# UCD-C-Assignments

**This repository will contain the practicals done with C programming in Ichec.**

## Practical 1

1. printing.C - Prints integer and floating numbers onto the screen
2. scanning.C - We obtain two numbers from the user and determine whether if its even or odd.

## Practical 2

1. Conversion.c - We convert an interger decimal to a binary and do cast conversion from int to float and print the three numbers.
2. sum.c - We find the sum of the given expression using for loop and find the same from reverse and display the difference.

## Practical 3

1. areaCurve.C - We have used the trapezodial rule to calculate area under the curve.

## Practical4

1. arrayFunctionPrac4.c - Contains the same area under the curve program but have used fuunctions to calculate the given degree to radians and to calculate the area.

## Practical5

1. fibonacci_prac5.c - Its a program to compute the fibonacci series till the given number number n.
2. maclaurinSeriesPrac5.c - Program to compute Maclaurin Series for a number

## Practical6

1. main.c - Main program to get input of two matrices and display its product
2. matmul.c - Contains the function to calculate matric multiplication
3. Makefile - contains the makefile to compile the two files and get an executable. 

## Practical7

1. exponentialP7.c - Contains code to calculate exponential using a function f(x) and find which order provides an accurate value.
2. pointerManipulationP7.c - Code to practice different kind of usage of pointers

## Practical8

1. recurssionPrac8.c - Contains code to find out gcd for two numbers using iterative function as well as recussive function.
