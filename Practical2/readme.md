1. conversion.c - We convert an interger decimal to a binary and do cast conversion from int to float and print the three numbers.

### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o conversion conversion.c
    2. ./conversion

2. sum.c - We find the sum of the given expression using for loop and find the same from reverse and display the difference.

### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o sum sum.c
    2. ./sum
