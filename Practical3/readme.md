## Practical 3

First we calculate the area of a curve using trapezoidal rule. Then we calculate the value of log(2). Then we check the difference between both the results. The difference must be minimal.

1. areaCurve.C - I have used the trapezodial rule to calculate area under the curve. This value should be approximately equal to log(2)

### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o areaCurve areaCurve.c
    2. ./areaCurve
