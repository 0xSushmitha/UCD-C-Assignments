## Practical4

Here, we have calculated the same area of a curve using trapezoidal rule but we have used functions to convert degrees to radians. 
The main aim is to use functions and write the program.

1. arrayFunctionPrac4.c - Contains the same area under the curve program but have used functions to calculate the given degree to radians and to calculate the area.

### Command to compile and run the code
    1. gcc -o arrayFunctionPrac4 arrayFunctionPrac4.c
    2. ./arrayFunctionPrac4
